# Faculty-portal
Abstract:
Faculty portals are specialized websites designed to provide academic staff members with essential information access. Our institution, Fr. C. Rodrigues Institute of Technology, comprises six distinct departments, each housing a diverse body of teaching and non-teaching personnel. Recognizing the need for an enhanced information management structure and a more streamlined approach to processing leave requests, we propose the development of a comprehensive leave application system using web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The proposed portal aims to reengineer the intricate landscape of employee leave management within our organization. Its core functionalities encompass not only the efficient orchestration of leave application processes but also the categorization and tracking of various leave types. Additionally, the portal will extend its utility to encompass storage of academic timetables, facilitating easy access, and enabling personnel to download their individual salary statements. The backbone of this solution rests on the utilization of SQL for seamless data retrieval and manipulation. Our overarching objective is to establish an interactive digital interface that supersedes traditional manual approaches to leave management, fostering a more precise, expedient, and digitally immersive environment. This transformational undertaking holds promise for heightened accuracy, operational efficiency, and accessibility in the realm of faculty administration.
